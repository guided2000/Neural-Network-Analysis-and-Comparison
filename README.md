# Neural Network Analysis and Comparison  
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate neural networks for regression and classification tasks using synthetic data.  

## Features  
- **Data Generation**: Synthetic dataset generation for regression or classification tasks.  
- **Data Splitting**: Training and testing split with a 70-30 ratio.  
- **Cross-Validation**: 10-fold cross-validation for initial model evaluation.  
- **Model Training**:  
  - Neural networks with one hidden layer.  
  - Neural networks with two hidden layers.  
- **Performance Comparison**: Analysis of model performance based on accuracy or error metrics.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8 or later  
- Required Libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
  ```  

### How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guided2000/neural-network-analysis.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   cd neural-network-analysis
   jupyter notebook neural_network_project.ipynb
   ```  
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the code and observe the results.  

## Project Structure  
- `neural_network_project.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the entire analysis.  

## Results  
The notebook provides:  
- Performance metrics for networks with different configurations of hidden layers.  
- Visualizations of training and testing results.
